## Introduction

The Library Management System CLI is a Python-based command-line interface application designed to simplify the management of book collections and user records in libraries. This system addresses the challenges faced by libraries, especially smaller ones, in managing their resources efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Many libraries, especially small ones, struggle with the inefficient management of their book collections and user records. The manual processes are prone to errors, time-consuming, and lack modern features that can enhance the user experience. Librarians need a straightforward and effective solution to streamline library operations.

## Solution

To address these challenges, we propose the development of a simplified Library Management System using Python's Command Line Interface (CLI). This system will offer core functionalities for librarians to efficiently manage books, user accounts, and checkouts. It aims to modernize library operations and improve the overall user experience.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### User Management
- Create and Manage User Accounts: Librarians can create and manage librarian and patron accounts, ensuring secure authentication.
- Authentication: Users can log in using their usernames and passwords.

### Catalog Management
- Add and View Book Records: Librarians can add new books to the catalog and view existing book records.
- Delete Book Records: Librarians can remove outdated or irrelevant book records.
- Search Books: Patrons can search for books by title, author, or genre.

### Check In/Out
- Check Books In and Out: Librarians can efficiently check books in and out for patrons, recording important details.
- Checkout and Due Dates: The system tracks checkout dates and calculates due dates.
- Return Books: Librarians can mark books as returned.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/joycewachira/Python-CLI-project](https://github.com/joycewachira/Python-CLI-project)
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Initialize the database to create tables for user accounts, book records, and checkouts.

## Usage

The CLI provides commands for user registration, book management, book checkout, and book return. Simply run the CLI and follow the prompts to perform these actions.
